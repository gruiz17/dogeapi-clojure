# dogeapi-clojure

A DogeAPI wrapper for clojure.

## Usage

Declare dogeapi-clojure in your project.clj file.


    (defproject whatever "x.x.x-SNAPSHOT"
      :dependencies [[dogeapi-clojure "0.1.0"]])


To use:

    ;; include dogeapi-clojure
    (require '[dogeapi-clojure.core :as doge])

    ;; create instance of doge with your api key and the api endpoint you want to use
    ;; version-number is either 1 or 2
    ;; note that some functionality is unavailable through version 1
    (def wow (init-doge "your-api-key" version-number))

If you're using v2, all the methods will return a map, like so:

    ;; example for calling get-balance
    => (doge/get-balance wow)
    {:data {:balance 1.9}}

If you're using v1, all the methods will return a string, like so:

    ;; example for calling get-balance
    => (doge/get-balance wow)
    "1.9"
